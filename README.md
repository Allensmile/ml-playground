Highly inspired by [MLAlgorithms](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms), which also provide clean and minimal code for machine learning algorithms. I would add more algorithms after I implement them.

## Supervised

- Linear Regression [[code]](supervised/linear_regression.py) [[demo]](linear_regression.ipynb)

- Logistic Regression [[code]](supervised/logistic_regression.py) [[demo]](logistic_regression.ipynb)

- Naive Bayes [[code]](supervised/naive_bayes.py) [[demo]](naive_bayes.ipynb)

- AdaBoost [[code]](supervised/adaboost.py) [[demo]](adaboost.ipynb)

## Unsupervised

- Kmeans [[code]](unsupervised/kmeans.py) [[demo]](kmeans.ipynb)

- PCA [[code]](unsupervised/pca.py) [[demo]](pca.ipynb)
